# This is a list of zonefiles and their type.
# M indicates that this is a modified zone and the file
# 'master.zone-name' should be used in the NSD config file.
# S means that it's a standard, parked or placeholder zone
# and the file 'master.standard.zonefile' should be used.
# F means a different standard zonefile should be used.
# In our case it's because the registrar for .fr (among others)
# requires working MX records, which is not true for other
# domain registrars. These are hardcoded in fbridge.rb
# for reasons of idleness. Your mileage may vary.
